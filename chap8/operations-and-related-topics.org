*** assignment
= variable assignment. No spaces allowed.

注意 = 用作 test operator 时，两边要有括号

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #   =  as a test operator

  if [ "$string1" = "$string2" ]
  then
     command
  fi

  #  if [ "X$string1" = "X$string2" ] is safer,
  #+ to prevent an error message should one of the variables be empty.
  #  (The prepended "X" characters cancel out.)
#+END_SRC

*** arithmetic operators

| +  | plus           |
| -  | minus          |
| *  | multiplication |
| /  | division       |
| ** | exponentiation |
| %  | modulo         |

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    # Bash, version 2.02, introduced the "**" exponentiation operator.
    let "z=5**3"    # 5 * 5 * 5
    echo "z = $z"   # z = 125
#+END_SRC
